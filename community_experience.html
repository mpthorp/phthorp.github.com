        <p>
          I have served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Mount Albert Grammar School between 1993 and 2006 and Chairman between 1995 and 2006.  I have also served as a committee member of the School's Albertians Association between 1989 and 2006, as its President between 1990 and 1993 and as Chairman of the Mount Albert Grammar School Foundation, a registered charitable trust associated with the School, since 2015.

        <h4>Ponsonby Rugby Club Incorporated</h4>
        <p>
          I have served as a member of the management committee of Ponsonby Rugby Club between 1990 and 2011, Chairman of the Club between 1999 and 2011, Chairman of its Ponies Association since 2014, Chairman of its Trustees since 2008 and President of the Club since 2019. The Club is the Auckland Rugby Football Union's oldest and most successful.  It has produced more All Blacks and international players than any other club in New Zealand and fields more teams than many provincial unions.  During my term as Chairman, the Club won the premier Auckland trophy, the Gallaher Shield, for a record 8 consecutive and 10 out of 11 years.
