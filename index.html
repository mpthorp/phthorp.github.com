        <p>
          I have been in practice since 1973 and have extensive experience in general civil and commercial litigation. After many years as a litigation partner, including two as managing partner, at Auckland law firm Martelli McKegg Wells & Cormack, I joined the independent Bar in 1991 and have practised since as a Barrister sole. I appear most regularly before the NZ High Court and Court of Appeal, but have also been admitted from time to time to the Cook Islands and Queensland Bar for cases there.
        </p>
        <p> 
          I am committed to providing quality, timely and practical advice intended to achieve an expeditious solution whether through the Courts or by negotiation, mediation or arbitration.

I am a committed Christian and chair three substantial Christian charitable trusts and a charitable trust associated with Mount Albert Grammar School. I have served as Chairman of the Mount Albert Grammar School Board of Trustees, as committee member and President of the School's Albertians Association and as Chairman of the Mount Albert Grammar School Foundation.
